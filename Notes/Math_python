+ : addition
- : subtraction
* : multiplication
/ : division 
% : modulus (returns the remainder)
** : exponent operator ex 3**2  3 raised to the power of 2.
// : floor division. Divide and round down ( -11/3 = -4)


Comparision Operators
== : equals to 
!= : not equal to  
<> : not equal to 
> : greater than 
< : less than

+= : adds value on the right to the item on the left
-= :  subtracts "

Logical Operators 
&&  : and : and...   the are just and, or, not in python
||  :  or : or
!   : not : not


Identity Operations
is : similar to equal to ( 3 is 3) like (3 = 3)

my_string = 'hello' - will store this in memory

'hello' is my_string ---True

is and = is the same.
is : true if operands are the same object ( 3 is 3)
is not : true if operands are not the same object


Membership Operators 
in : checks if the operand on the left is in operand on the right (i.e 3 in [1,2,3])
[1, 2, 3] in [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

not in : checks if the operand on the left is not in operand on the right

 3 not in [1,2]  = true
